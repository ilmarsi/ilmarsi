- 👋 Hi, I’m @ilmarsi. I am a PhD student of the “Joint PhD program in Cognitive Neuroscience” at the Psychology Department of the University of Bologna, Center of Cognitive Neuroscience in Cesena. 
I conducted EEG experiments on audiovisual integration processes and their underlying brain oscillatory activity, and I investigate  these same mechanisms using web-based psychophysical paradigms. Furthermore, my research activity is focused in investigating the EEG correlates of attentional zoom-lens anomalies in individuals with ASD using multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA-EEG).
- 👀 Currently, I am carrying out my research activity in the Center of Cognitive Neuroscience in Cesena under the supervision of Prof. Caterina Bertini. 
My main research interests concerns the study of how the oscillatory brain activity drives visual and attentional performance in the healthy population, the study of how this neural activity is abnormal in patients affected by visual field defects and the investigation of how brain EEG oscillations can be functionally modulated with the use of sensory entrainment and NIBS techniques.
- My space on github will be used in order to share my knowledge that will facilitate the analysis of EEG data on Matlab, using the Eeglab and Fieldtrip functions. 
I will make my codes available, which will allow students and novice people to conduct simple EEG analyses.
